# Overview
Medic Vision Scan is a cutting-edge Android app designed to detect cataracts, utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms to allow users to perform an initial assessment of their eye health independently. The app processes captured eye images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained with a diverse dataset of cataract images. This neural network accurately identifies and classifies potential signs of cataracts, thus providing users with a quick and accurate initial diagnosis. 

The backend of the app leverages Google Cloud's powerful infrastructure to perform efficient image preprocessing and real-time analysis. By utilizing cloud-based processing, the app offloads computationally intensive tasks to Google's powerful servers, ensuring that users receive fast and reliable feedback without straining their device resources. This cloud integration enables scalable and high-performance data processing, providing fast and accurate results. Thus, Medic Vision Scan combines the convenience of mobile health monitoring with the power of cloud computing to provide a smooth and effective cataract detection experience.

# Background
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 42% of blindness cases worldwide caused by cataracts originate from Southeast Asia.

 Indonesia holds the highest incidence rate of cataracts in Southeast Asia, at 1.5%. On a global scale, Indonesia ranks third in terms of blindness rates, standing at 1.47%.
